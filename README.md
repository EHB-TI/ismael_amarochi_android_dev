# Parcel Tracking Application
Werkstuk Android Development

In order to see the code you have to navigate to the `master` branch. 
 
Whenever you try to add any parcels to the list, it may tell you that an error has occured. In this case just try to add it againg, it should work the second time. I have not found the issue causing this error. Also, since i use an external api to get the parcel data, i am not sure it works with parcels delivered to Belgium. I have tried different of my own packages but it does not seem to function properly. The api i use has demo parcels, which means we can use demo parcel numbers to get correct data. These demo parcel numbers are the following `TESTPACKAGEATPICKUPPOINT`, `TESTPACKAGELOADEDFORDELIVERY`, `TESTPACKAGEEDI`, `TESTPACKAGEDELIVERED`. When these numbers are used the data is retreived and put into the list.
